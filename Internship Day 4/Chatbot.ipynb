    "1. re: \n",

    "> This dictionary responses maps specific patterns (like \"hello\", \"hi\", \"how are you\", etc.) to corresponding responses that the chatbot will use.\n",
    "> Each key in the dictionary is a pattern or keyword that the chatbot will look for in the user's input.\n",
    "> The \"default\" key is used when no other pattern matches the user's input, providing a fallback response.\n",

    "3. Function to Get a Response:\n",
    ">The get_response function processes the user's input and determines the appropriate response.\n",
    ">user_input.lower() converts the user's input to lowercase to ensure the matching is case-insensitive.\n",
    ">The for loop iterates over each pattern in the responses dictionary.\n",

    ">If no match is found, the function returns the \"default\" response.\n",

    "4. Main Function to Start the Chat\n",
    ">The chat function starts the chatbot and handles the interaction with the user.\n",
    ">It prints an initial greeting to the user.\n",
    ">The function enters a while True loop that runs indefinitely, allowing continuous conversation.\n",
    ">The input(\"You: \") line captures the user's input from the console.\n",
    ">If the user types \"bye\", the chatbot prints a goodbye message and exits the loop, ending the chat.\n",
    ">Otherwise, the get_response function is called to determine the appropriate response based on the user's input, and the chatbot's response is printed."
